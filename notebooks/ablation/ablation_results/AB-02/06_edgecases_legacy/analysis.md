### ✅ 1 — What is the purpose of the tblCustomer table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9921 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblCustomer table stores customer master data including customer codes, names, email addresses, and region information. It uses Hungarian notation with the str prefix for string fields and contains both legacy fields (strCustID, strFullName) and new migration compatibility fields (cust_id, custo…

**System answer:**
> The `tblCustomer` table stores customer master data from the legacy CRM system. In the business glossary, it is the table where customer records are stored, using legacy customer identifiers inherited from the AS/400 system.

### ✅ 2 — How are customers identified in the legacy system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8294 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Customers are identified by strCustID, which is a VARCHAR(50) field containing alphanumeric customer codes inherited from an AS/400 system. These codes follow formats like C-XXXXX or REG-XXXX and can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.

**System answer:**
> In the legacy CustomerMaster system, customers are identified by `strCustID` in the `tblCustomer` table. This is the primary key and the required unique customer code for each customer. The context says it is an alphanumeric identifier inherited from the AS/400 system, stored as `VARCHAR(50)`, not null, and unique.

### ✅ 3 — What table stores order header information and what is its primary key?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5107 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Order header information is stored in the vw_SalesOrderHdr table despite the vw_ prefix suggesting it's a view. The primary key is lngOrderID, which is an INT field using the lng (long integer) Hungarian notation prefix.

**System answer:**
> Order header information is stored in `vw_SalesOrderHdr`, described as the sales order header table and core transactional data. The retrieved context does not provide the primary key for `vw_SalesOrderHdr`, so I cannot identify its primary key from the available information.

### ✅ 4 — Which table in the schema uses a SQL reserved word as its name?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5119 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The schema includes two tables that use SQL reserved words: 'Group' (for product categories) and 'User' (for system users). These require square bracket quoting [Group] and [User] in SQL queries to avoid syntax errors.

**System answer:**
> The schema uses two SQL reserved words as table names: `Group` and `User`. The context states both are reserved words and must be quoted as `[Group]` and `[User]`.

### ✅ 5 — What is the relationship between vw_SalesOrderHdr and tblCustomer?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9359 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> vw_SalesOrderHdr has a foreign key relationship with tblCustomer through the intCustID field, which references strCustID. Despite the int prefix suggesting an integer, intCustID is actually a VARCHAR(50) field matching the strCustID data type.

**System answer:**
> `vw_SalesOrderHdr` is the sales order header entity, and it depends on `tblCustomer`. The context states that `tblCustomer` is “required for all orders,” and also notes a referential integrity issue that “some orders reference customers marked as inactive.” Taken together, this shows that each order in `vw_SalesOrderHdr` is associated with a customer record in `tblCustomer`.

### ✅ 6 — What naming convention is used for the inventory transaction log table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9306 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The inventory transaction log table is named 'inv_txn_log' using abbreviated naming with underscore separators. Field names within this table are also heavily abbreviated: txn_id (transaction ID), txn_dt (transaction date), txn_type (transaction type), and prod_id (product ID).

**System answer:**
> The inventory transaction log table, `inv_txn_log`, uses a heavily abbreviated naming convention. The context also shows it follows the `inv_` table prefix pattern.

**Sources retrieved (10):** `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_6`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_2`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_7`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_3`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_4`, `parent_chunk_data_dictionary.txt_8`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_0`, `parent_chunk_business_glossary.md_1`

### ✅ 7 — What data quality issue exists in the tblProduct unit_cost field?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8594 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblProduct.unit_cost field has an inappropriate data type - it's defined as VARCHAR(20) instead of DECIMAL. This field contains currency symbols like '$19.99' which require parsing before calculations can be performed, making it unusable for mathematical operations without transformation.

**System answer:**
> The `tblProduct.unit_cost` field has an inappropriate data type and bad data formatting: it is stored as `VARCHAR 20` instead of a numeric type, is explicitly marked as a bug, contains currency symbols such as `"$19.99"`, and therefore must be parsed before calculations. The context says it should be `DECIMAL`.

### ✅ 8 — How does the ord_line_item table handle product data redundancy?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.4883 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The ord_line_item table contains redundant copies of product data (product_code and item_name) that are denormalized for reporting performance and to snapshot product information at the time of order. These fields may become out of sync with the tblProduct master and should not be updated from produ…

**System answer:**
> The `ord_line_item` table handles product data redundancy by storing both a product reference and duplicated product attributes.

It includes `prod_id`, which is the product link, but it also keeps `product_code` as a redundant copy of `tblProduct.strSKU` and `item_name` as a redundant copy of the product name. The context says `product_code` is denormalized for reporting performance, but it may b…

### ✅ 9 — What are the valid values for the strOrderStatus field in vw_SalesOrderHdr?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9131 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The strOrderStatus field accepts three values enforced by a CHECK constraint: 'PENDING' (order received but not shipped), 'SHIPPED' (order has been shipped to customer), and 'CANCELLED' (order cancelled before shipping).

**System answer:**
> The retrieved context does not enumerate the valid values for `vw_SalesOrderHdr.strOrderStatus`, so an exact allowed-value list cannot be given from the available evidence.

What the context does show is that order status values are audited in `tblOrderStatusHistory`, where:
`OrderID` is a foreign key to `vw_SalesOrderHdr.lngOrderID`,
`OldStatus` is the previous status value,
`NewStatus` is the ne…

### ✅ 10 — Which table stores payment information and what security issue does it have?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.3347 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Payment information is stored in the tblPayment table. The table has a critical security issue: the CardNumberText field stores full unencrypted credit card numbers as VARCHAR(100), which is a PCI compliance violation. The system also lacks proper tokenization and encryption at rest.

**System answer:**
> The payment information is stored in `tblPayment`. The context describes it as containing core payment transaction fields such as `PaymentID`, `OrderID`, `PaymentMethod`, `PaymentDate`, `Amount`, `PaymentStatus`, `AuthorizationCode`, `CardNumberText`, and `CardHolderName`, and identifies it as physically storing individual payment transactions.

The security issue is that `tblPayment.CardNumberTex…

### ✅ 11 — What is the purpose of the bolActive field in tblCustomer and tblProduct?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9646 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The bolActive field (using Hungarian notation 'bol' for boolean/bit) is a flag indicating whether a record is active. In tblCustomer, it marks whether customers are included in marketing (1=active, 0=inactive). In tblProduct, it indicates product availability (1=available for sale, 0=discontinued).

**System answer:**
> For `tblCustomer`, the context does provide the purpose of `bolActive`: in the business glossary for the `Customer` concept, customers “can be marked as inactive (`bolActive = 0`) but are never deleted.” So the field is used to indicate whether a customer is active or inactive, with inactivation used instead of deleting customer records.

For `tblProduct`, the retrieved context does not include a …

### ✅ 12 — How are inventory transactions tracked in the system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.1259 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> Inventory transactions are tracked in the inv_txn_log table, which records all stock movements. Each transaction has a type (txn_type): 'IN' for receipts, 'OUT' for shipments, and 'ADJ' for corrections. The table uses heavily abbreviated field names and references products via prod_id.

**System answer:**
> Inventory transactions are tracked through the `inv_txn_log` table, which is described as the system’s inventory audit trail. In the migration guidelines, `inv_txn_log` is classified as a secondary-priority table, meaning it can be migrated in parallel rather than on the critical path. The context also notes a referential integrity gap on this table: `inv_txn_log.user_id` has no foreign key constr…

### ✅ 13 — What is the self-referencing relationship in the Group table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8372 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The Group table has a self-referencing foreign key where ParentGroupID references GroupID, creating a hierarchical structure for product categories. A NULL ParentGroupID indicates a top-level group, while non-NULL values create nested category levels.

**System answer:**
> The `Group` table has a self-referencing one-to-many hierarchy using `ParentGroupID`. This means one `Group` record can be the parent of multiple other `Group` records, forming a hierarchical group/category structure for category navigation.

### ✅ 14 — What migration compatibility columns exist in tblCustomer?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.6606 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**System answer:**
> The system tracks order status changes in the `tblOrderStatusHistory` table, whose stated purpose is an audit log of order status changes. Each history row represents one status transition for an order.

At the schema level, it works as follows: `tblOrderStatusHistory.OrderID` is a foreign key to `vw_SalesOrderHdr.lngOrderID`, so each status history record is tied to a specific order header. The t…

### ✅ 16 — What is the inconsistent naming pattern between order tables?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.2869 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The schema shows inconsistent naming: order headers use 'vw_SalesOrderHdr' with Hungarian notation, while line items use 'ord_line_item' with abbreviated underscore notation. Additionally, the line item table references lngOrderID but names its foreign key 'ord_id' instead of 'order_id' or 'lngOrder…

**System answer:**
> The order tables use inconsistent prefixes: the order header is named `vw_SalesOrderHdr` with a `vw_` prefix even though it is actually a table, while the order detail table is named `ord_line_item` with an `ord_` prefix. This reflects the broader legacy naming inconsistency described in the system.

### ✅ 17 — What deprecated fields exist in tblProduct and why should they be avoided?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.6637 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblProduct table contains three deprecated fields: prod_num (superseded by strSKU), item_desc (superseded by strDescription), and unit_cost (wrong data type with VARCHAR instead of DECIMAL). These fields should not be used in new code as they represent outdated design decisions.

**System answer:**
> In `tblProduct`, the deprecated fields are `prod_num`, `item_desc`, and `unit_cost`.

`prod_num` (`VARCHAR 20`) is the old legacy product number. It is superseded by `strSKU` and retained only for historical reporting, so it should be avoided in new code.

`item_desc` (`VARCHAR 500`) is the old truncated description. It is superseded by `strDescription`, and the dictionary explicitly says not to u…

### ✅ 18 — How are shipping carriers configured in the system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.2613 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Shipping carriers are stored in the tblShippingCarrier table with CarrierID, CarrierName, CarrierCode (for API integration), TrackingURL (with {TRACKING_NUM} placeholder), and bolActive flag. Only carriers with bolActive=1 should be offered during checkout.

**System answer:**
> Shipping carriers are configured as shipping carrier master data in `tblShippingCarrier`. In the business glossary, a shipping carrier is defined as a third-party logistics provider responsible for delivering packages to customers.

### ✅ 19 — What is the relationship between User table passwords and security?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0024 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> The User table stores password hashes in the PasswordHash field, but uses SHA-256 without salt, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. This is identified as a security issue in the data dictionary. Additionally, the table name 'User' is a SQL reserved word requiring square bracket quoting.

**System answer:**
> From the retrieved context, the only information about the `User` table is that it exists, represents system users, and because `User` is a SQL reserved word it must be quoted as `[User]`. The context does not describe any password column, password storage method, encryption, hashing, authentication rules, or any security behavior tied to `User` passwords.

### ✅ 20 — What fields in vw_SalesOrderHdr use the 'flt' Hungarian notation prefix and what do they store?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8797 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The vw_SalesOrderHdr table uses the 'flt' (float) prefix for three monetary fields: fltSubTotal (line item subtotal before tax), fltTaxAmount (calculated tax), and fltTotalAmount (final total including tax and shipping). Despite the 'flt' prefix suggesting floating-point, these are defined as DECIMA…

**System answer:**
> From the retrieved context, the only `vw_SalesOrderHdr` field explicitly shown with the `flt` Hungarian notation prefix is `fltTotalAmount`. Based on the notation guide, `flt` denotes a float/money value stored as `DECIMAL`, and the field stores the order’s total amount. The context also notes that some `vw_SalesOrderHdr` records have `fltTotalAmount = 0`, suggesting possible failed calculations.

### ✅ 21 — How does the schema handle the different date/time field naming conventions?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.1757 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> The schema uses 'dtm' (datetime) Hungarian notation prefix consistently: dtmCreated and dtmLastModified in tblCustomer, dtmOrderDate/dtmShipDate/dtmRequiredDate in vw_SalesOrderHdr, dtmIntroduced/dtmDiscontinued in tblProduct, and txn_dt in inv_txn_log (abbreviated exception). The User table breaks …

**System answer:**
> The schema uses mixed date/time naming conventions.

In the legacy Hungarian notation pattern, date/time columns use the `dtm` prefix, where `dtm` means `DATETIME`. The context explicitly defines `dtm = datetime (DATETIME)`, and examples include `dtmIntroduced`, `dtmDiscontinued`, and `dtmRequiredDate`.

At the same time, other parts of the schema use plain descriptive names without the `dtm` pref…

### ✅ 23 — What foreign key relationships exist for the vw_SalesOrderHdr table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8112 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The vw_SalesOrderHdr table has one explicit foreign key constraint: intCustID references tblCustomer.strCustID. Implicit relationships (not enforced by FK constraints) include tblPayment.OrderID, tblOrderStatusHistory.OrderID, and ord_line_item.ord_id all referencing vw_SalesOrderHdr.lngOrderID.

**System answer:**
> From the retrieved context, the only explicit foreign key relationship shown for `vw_SalesOrderHdr` is that `tblOrderStatusHistory.OrderID` is a foreign key to `vw_SalesOrderHdr.lngOrderID`.

The context also indicates that `vw_SalesOrderHdr` is the core order header table and that orders are related to customers and line items: `tblCustomer` is “required for all orders,” some orders reference ina…

### ✅ 24 — How does the legacy system handle product SKU format and uniqueness?

**Status:** GROUNDED

**System answer:**
> From the retrieved context, the legacy product SKU is stored as `tblProduct.strSKU`, and the older `prod_num` field is deprecated: `prod_num` is the old legacy product number and has been superseded by `strSKU`, though it is retained for historical reporting.
