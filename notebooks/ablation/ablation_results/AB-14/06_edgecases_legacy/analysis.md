It uses Hungarian notation with the str prefix for string fields and contains both legacy fields (strCustID, strFullName) and new migration compatibility fields (cust_id, custo…

**System answer:**
> The purpose of `tblCustomer` is to store customer master data from the legacy CRM system. It is the legacy customer master table for individuals or organizations that have purchased products or services from the company. The context describes it as holding core master-data attributes such as customer identifier, name, email, region, country, status/active flag, and notes, with legacy customer iden…

### ✅ 2 — How are customers identified in the legacy system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8295 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Customers are identified by strCustID, which is a VARCHAR(50) field containing alphanumeric customer codes inherited from an AS/400 system. These codes follow formats like C-XXXXX or REG-XXXX and can contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.

**System answer:**
> In the legacy CustomerMaster system, customers are identified primarily by `tblCustomer.strCustID`. This is the primary key for the customer master table and is described as the unique customer code inherited from the AS/400 system. It is an alphanumeric identifier, not null, unique, and stored as `VARCHAR(50)`. The documented format is `C-XXXXX` or `REG-XXXX`, and it can contain letters, numbers,…

### ✅ 3 — What table stores order header information and what is its primary key?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8391 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Order header information is stored in the vw_SalesOrderHdr table despite the vw_ prefix suggesting it's a view. The primary key is lngOrderID, which is an INT field using the lng (long integer) Hungarian notation prefix.

**System answer:**
> Order header information is stored in VW_SALESORDERHDR, which implements the business concept “Sales order header records.” The relevant key column is lngOrderID, because related tables such as ORD_LINE_ITEM and TBLPAYMENT reference VW_SALESORDERHDR.lngOrderID. However, the retrieved context does not explicitly state that lngOrderID is the primary key.

### ✅ 4 — Which table in the schema uses a SQL reserved word as its name?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.5119 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The schema includes two tables that use SQL reserved words: 'Group' (for product categories) and 'User' (for system users). These require square bracket quoting [Group] and [User] in SQL queries to avoid syntax errors.

**System answer:**
> The schema uses two SQL reserved words as table names: `Group` and `User`. The context explicitly says both are reserved words and must be quoted as `[Group]` and `[User]`.

### ✅ 5 — What is the relationship between vw_SalesOrderHdr and tblCustomer?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9940 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> vw_SalesOrderHdr has a foreign key relationship with tblCustomer through the intCustID field, which references strCustID. Despite the int prefix suggesting an integer, intCustID is actually a VARCHAR(50) field matching the strCustID data type.

**System answer:**
> `vw_SalesOrderHdr` references `tblCustomer` through a foreign key: `vw_SalesOrderHdr.intCustID` -> `tblCustomer.strCustID`.

This means each sales order header record is linked to a customer master record in `tblCustomer` by the customer identifier. In the business glossary, `tblCustomer` stores customers and `strCustID` is the unique customer code. The `vw_SalesOrderHdr` table includes `intCustID…

### ✅ 6 — What naming convention is used for the inventory transaction log table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9306 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The inventory transaction log table is named 'inv_txn_log' using abbreviated naming with underscore separators. Field names within this table are also heavily abbreviated: txn_id (transaction ID), txn_dt (transaction date), txn_type (transaction type), and prod_id (product ID).

**System answer:**
> The inventory transaction log table `inv_txn_log` uses a heavily abbreviated naming convention. In the legacy naming overview, it also falls under the `inv_` prefix style.

### ✅ 7 — What data quality issue exists in the tblProduct unit_cost field?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8594 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblProduct.unit_cost field has an inappropriate data type - it's defined as VARCHAR(20) instead of DECIMAL. This field contains currency symbols like '$19.99' which require parsing before calculations can be performed, making it unusable for mathematical operations without transformation.

**System answer:**
> The `tblProduct.unit_cost` field has a data quality issue because it is stored as `VARCHAR 20` instead of a numeric type. The context explicitly says it is an old field where cost is stored as a string, this is a bug, it should be `DECIMAL`, and it contains currency symbols such as `"$19.99"`, so it requires parsing before calculations.

### ✅ 8 — How does the ord_line_item table handle product data redundancy?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9310 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The ord_line_item table contains redundant copies of product data (product_code and item_name) that are denormalized for reporting performance and to snapshot product information at the time of order. These fields may become out of sync with the tblProduct master and should not be updated from produ…

**System answer:**
> `ord_line_item` stores product data both by reference and by redundant snapshots.

It has `prod_id`, a foreign key to `TBLPRODUCT.INTPRODID`, so the line item is linked to the master product record. In addition, it stores two redundant product attributes directly in the line-item row: `product_code` and `item_name`.

`product_code` is a redundant copy of `tblProduct.strSKU`. It is explicitly denor…

### ✅ 9 — What are the valid values for the strOrderStatus field in vw_SalesOrderHdr?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9131 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The strOrderStatus field accepts three values enforced by a CHECK constraint: 'PENDING' (order received but not shipped), 'SHIPPED' (order has been shipped to customer), and 'CANCELLED' (order cancelled before shipping).

**System answer:**
> The retrieved context does not enumerate the valid values for `vw_SalesOrderHdr.strOrderStatus`.

What the context does confirm is that `strOrderStatus` is a column on `VW_SALESORDERHDR`, and order status changes are audited in `tblOrderStatusHistory`. That history table stores `OldStatus` and `NewStatus` as `VARCHAR(20)`, with `OrderID` as a foreign key to `VW_SALESORDERHDR.lngOrderID`. `OldStatu…

### ✅ 10 — Which table stores payment information and what security issue does it have?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0845 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> Payment information is stored in the tblPayment table. The table has a critical security issue: the CardNumberText field stores full unencrypted credit card numbers as VARCHAR(100), which is a PCI compliance violation. The system also lacks proper tokenization and encryption at rest.

**System answer:**
> Payment information is stored in `tblPayment`. The context describes it as a payment transaction record and maps it to physical table `TBLPAYMENT` with columns including `PaymentID`, `OrderID`, `PaymentMethod`, `PaymentDate`, `Amount`, `PaymentStatus`, `CardNumberText`, `CardHolderName`, and `AuthorizationCode`.

The key security issue is that `tblPayment.CardNumberText` stores unencrypted card nu…

### ✅ 11 — What is the purpose of the bolActive field in tblCustomer and tblProduct?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9646 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The bolActive field (using Hungarian notation 'bol' for boolean/bit) is a flag indicating whether a record is active. In tblCustomer, it marks whether customers are included in marketing (1=active, 0=inactive). In tblProduct, it indicates product availability (1=available for sale, 0=discontinued).

**System answer:**
> For `tblCustomer`, the context explicitly says customers “can be marked as inactive (`bolActive = 0`) but are never deleted,” so `bolActive` is used at least to record customer inactivity.

For `tblProduct`, the context shows that the table includes a `bolActive` column, but it does not explicitly define that column’s purpose. What the context does say is that `tblProduct` contains both active and…

### ✅ 12 — How are inventory transactions tracked in the system?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.4369 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> Inventory transactions are tracked in the inv_txn_log table, which records all stock movements. Each transaction has a type (txn_type): 'IN' for receipts, 'OUT' for shipments, and 'ADJ' for corrections. The table uses heavily abbreviated field names and references products via prod_id.

**System answer:**
> Inventory transactions are tracked through the business concept Product → Inventory Transactions, which is implemented by the physical table INV_TXN_LOG / inv_txn_log.

From the context, inv_txn_log is described as the inventory transaction log and also as an inventory audit trail. The table stores these columns: txn_id, prod_id, txn_type, qty, txn_dt, ref_num, user_id, and notes.

### ✅ 13 — What is the self-referencing relationship in the Group table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.8158 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The Group table has a self-referencing foreign key where ParentGroupID references GroupID, creating a hierarchical structure for product categories. A NULL ParentGroupID indicates a top-level group, while non-NULL values create nested category levels.

**System answer:**
> The `Group` table has a self-referencing foreign key where `ParentGroupID` points to `Group.GroupID`. This creates a hierarchy of product groups/categories, so each group can have a parent group. Because `Group` is a reserved word in SQL, the context notes it must be quoted as `[Group]`.

### ✅ 16 — What is the inconsistent naming pattern between order tables?

**Status:** GROUNDED

Additionally, the line item table references lngOrderID but names its foreign key 'ord_id' instead of 'order_id' or 'lngOrder…

**System answer:**
> The order-related tables use mixed naming conventions rather than one consistent pattern.

### ✅ 17 — What deprecated fields exist in tblProduct and why should they be avoided?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.6637 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The tblProduct table contains three deprecated fields: prod_num (superseded by strSKU), item_desc (superseded by strDescription), and unit_cost (wrong data type with VARCHAR instead of DECIMAL). These fields should not be used in new code as they represent outdated design decisions.

**System answer:**
> In `tblProduct`, the deprecated legacy fields are `prod_num`, `item_desc`, and `unit_cost`.

`prod_num` (`VARCHAR 20`) is the old legacy product number. It has been superseded by `strSKU` and is retained only for historical reporting, so it should be avoided for current implementations.

`item_desc` (`VARCHAR 500`) is the old truncated description. It has been superseded by `strDescription`, and t…

### ✅ 18 — How are shipping carriers configured in the system?

**Status:** GROUNDED

### ✅ 19 — What is the relationship between User table passwords and security?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0401 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**
> The User table stores password hashes in the PasswordHash field, but uses SHA-256 without salt, making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. This is identified as a security issue in the data dictionary. Additionally, the table name 'User' is a SQL reserved word requiring square bracket quoting.

**System answer:**
> The `User` table (business concept: “System users”) stores passwords in the `PasswordHash` column of physical table `USER` (`UserID, UserName, PasswordHash, UserRole, Email, LastLogin, CreatedDate`).

The security issue identified is that `User.PasswordHash` uses SHA-256 without salt. The context marks this as a security and compliance problem because it is vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. The…

### ✅ 20 — What fields in vw_SalesOrderHdr use the 'flt' Hungarian notation prefix and what do they store?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9078 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The vw_SalesOrderHdr table uses the 'flt' (float) prefix for three monetary fields: fltSubTotal (line item subtotal before tax), fltTaxAmount (calculated tax), and fltTotalAmount (final total including tax and shipping). Despite the 'flt' prefix suggesting floating-point, these are defined as DECIMA…

**System answer:**
> In `VW_SALESORDERHDR`, the fields with the `flt` Hungarian notation prefix are `fltSubTotal`, `fltTaxAmount`, and `fltTotalAmount`.

From the glossary mapping, these are columns on the sales order header, and from the legacy notation guide, the `flt` prefix indicates a float/money value stored as `DECIMAL`. Based on the field names, they store the order subtotal, tax amount, and total amount respe…

**System answer:**
> The schema does not use one consistent date/time naming convention across all tables.

The retrieved context says the legacy system uses Hungarian notation, where `dtm` means a `DATETIME` field, and it gives examples such as `dtmIntroduced`, `dtmDiscontinued`, and in `vw_SalesOrderHdr`, `dtmOrderDate`, `dtmShipDate`, and `dtmRequiredDate`.

### ✅ 22 — What table prefix patterns exist in the schema and what do they indicate?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.0907 | **Gate:** `proceed_with_warning`

**Expected answer:**

Two tables (G…

**System answer:**
> The schema uses several table prefix patterns, and the context says they are inconsistent across the legacy system.

`tbl` indicates standard tables, for example `tblCustomer`, `tblProduct`, `tblPayment`, and `tblOrderStatusHistory`.

`vw_` appears to indicate a view-style name, but the context explicitly says these are actually tables; the example given is `vw_SalesOrderHdr`.

### ✅ 23 — What foreign key relationships exist for the vw_SalesOrderHdr table?

**Status:** GROUNDED  
**GT Coverage:** 100% | **Top Score:** 0.9902 | **Gate:** `proceed`

**Expected answer:**
> The vw_SalesOrderHdr table has one explicit foreign key constraint: intCustID references tblCustomer.strCustID. Implicit relationships (not enforced by FK constraints) include tblPayment.OrderID, tblOrderStatusHistory.OrderID, and ord_line_item.ord_id all referencing vw_SalesOrderHdr.lngOrderID.

**System answer:**
> For `vw_SalesOrderHdr`, the retrieved context shows one outgoing foreign key and three incoming foreign keys.

`vw_SalesOrderHdr.intCustID` references `TBLCUSTOMER.STRCUSTID`, so each sales order header is linked to a customer. The context also notes a legacy naming inconsistency: `intCustID` is actually a `VARCHAR`, even though the prefix suggests integer.

Three tables reference `vw_SalesOrderHd…

### ✅ 24 — How does the legacy system handle product SKU format and uniqueness?

**Status:** GROUNDED

**Expected answer:**
> Product SKUs are stored in the strSKU field with a UNIQUE constraint. The format follows Category-Color-Size pattern (e.g., 'SHIRT-BLU-L'). The deprecated prod_num field also exists but should not be used. SKUs are used in foreign key references from ord_line_item through the denormalized product_co…

**System answer:**
> From the retrieved context, the legacy product identifier is `tblProduct.strSKU`. The older field `prod_num` is deprecated and explicitly “superseded by `strSKU`,” so new code should use `strSKU` rather than `prod_num`.

The context does not provide a documented SKU format rule comparable to the customer code format. The only SKU-format-related statement is a data quality note saying `tblProduct` …

**System answer:**
> The migration context identifies several serious data quality and migration-readiness issues.

The core data quality issues are the referential integrity gaps: some `ord_line_item.prod_id` values point to non-existent `tblProduct` records because products were deleted, some orders reference customers in `tblCustomer` who are marked inactive, and `inv_txn_log.user_id` has no foreign key constraint.…
